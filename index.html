	<p>Thanks for tuning in. I've finally settled on the page layout and 
	colour scheme of the site, and now it's time to put in some actual 
	content. The following is a list of things I plan to do next, roughly 
	in the order I plan to do them:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Filling in about, articles, and contact pages</li>
		<li>French translations</li>
		<li>Articles on buying a domain name and making a website</li>
		<li>Articles on Linux kernel module development</li>
		<li>French translations of these articles</li>
		<li>Migrating my <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/element118s-delag-of-3d-engine-definitive-version/6501147889270784">
		3D engine</a> from Khan Academy to a native js canvas</li>
		<li>Setting up public forums on this website</li>
		<li>Maybe making my own BBS. Why not, right?</li>
		<li>...and of course, more French translations</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When will this be done? Well, I expect I can finish the first two 
	items by next week. Once I start writing articles and getting a feel 
	for how much effort that takes, I'll put together a more formal 
	schedule</p> 
	
	<p>Note: I realize very few people actually care about my publishing 
	schedule, but this website was my New Year's Resolution; I want to 
	break my usual pattern of dropping projects once the initial excitement 
	calms down.</p>
