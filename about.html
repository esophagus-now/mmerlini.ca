	<hr>
	
	<p>My name is Marco Merlini. I'm from New Brunswick, Canada, and I 
	currently live in Toronto.</p>
	
	<p>As of January 3rd, 2020, I'm pursuing a Master's at the University 
	of Toronto. My research goal is to develop better tools for debugging 
	multi-FPGA projects. My expected graduation is in September 2020. </p>

	<hr>
	<p>I made this site using <a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a>, 
	my all-time favourite editor. I registered this domain via <a href="https://www.hover.com/">
	hover</a>, and I'm using a VM instance on the Google Cloud Platform to 
	host the page. The server is running Apache. I use SFTPDrive to edit 
	the files from my home computer. I use the excellent <a href="https://tohtml.com/">
	tohtml.com</a> to format code on the site.</p>
	
	<p>The domain costs me about $20 (Canadian) per year. Google Cloud 
	Platform <i>claims</i> that this VM is in the "always free" tier, but I 
	don't really believe that. The normal cost for these sever resources 
	(tiny CPU, 600ish MB of RAM, 10 GB persistent disk) would be about $5 
	(Canadian) per month. </p> 
	
	<p>This layout and some of the CSS/HTML is inspired by <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/">
	Fabien Sanglard's website</a>. Otherwise, most of what I learned about 
	HTML and CSS is from the excellent <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">
	w3schools</a>. I use <a href="https://tohtml.com/"> tohtml.com</a> to 
	format the source code on the pages. </p> 
	
	<p>By the way, I eventually decided it was time to make this website 
	because of two things:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A good friend of mine bought me one of those Wacom tablets, 
		since I had mentioned wanting to make explainer videos </li>
		<li>I stumbled onto Julia Evans's site for the n<sup>th</sup> 
		time. She has so much interesting stuff and has helped me fix 
		several coding problems over the years.</li>
	</ul>
