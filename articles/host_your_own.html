	<h1>Creating your Own Website from Scratch</h1>
	<hr>
	
	<p class="date"> January 7, 2020 </p>
	
	<p>Note that there are easy ways to make a website. If all you need is 
	a couple of pages, you should just use Squarespace.</p>
	
	<p>Of course, I only needed a couple of pages, but for whatever reason 
	I was compelled to do everything myself. This entails:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Buying/managing a domain name</li>
		<li>Hosting the content (which could include the Apache web 
		    server)</li>
		<li>Actually writing up HTML and CSS</li>
		<li>For fancy things on the client side, writing JS</li>
		<li>For fancy things on the server side, using any one of a HUGE
		    list of available pieces of software. Traditionally, this is 
		    PHP with a mySQL database. </li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This article only deals with the first two items, after a brief 
	refresher on how websites work.</p>
</div>

<div class="card" id="how_web_works">
	<h2>How Websites Work</h2>
	<hr>
	
	<p>First, check out this diagram. Each of the three icons on the bottom 
	represents a computer accessing the web. The gray box at the top 
	represents a computer that serves a website. The arrows represent the 
	flow of messages between two points.</p>
	
	<img src="host_your_own/how_web_works.png" alt="Quick and dirty web block diagram">
	
	<p>In general, when a <i>client</i> accesses a website, web requests 
	are sent to a specific computer via the internet. This computer is 
	referred to as a <i>server</i>. For my website, the server is a computer 
	that I rent from Google.</p>
	
	<p>All web requests arriving at the server computer go through the 
	<i>web server software</i>. My web server software is the <a 
	href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> program. It is the web 
	server software that decides what to send back to the clients. On many 
	websites (including this one) the web server software is configured to 
	send back files that are stored on the server's hard drive.</p>
	
	<div class="inset"> 
	<div class="inset_title">Try this now!</div> 
	<p>Right-click on this page and select "View page source". On some web 
	browsers, you can also hit CTRL-U. This will show you the actual code 
	that I (lovingly) typed into the files on my server. Apache is sending 
	these files back to your computer as plain text; it is your <i>web 
	browser</i> that presents them as nice web pages.</p>
	</div>

<div class="card" id="getting_a_domain">
	<h2>Getting a Domain Name</h2>
	<hr>
	
	<p>A <i>domain name</i> is the name of a website that you type into 
	your browser. This website's domain name is <span class="code"> 
	mmerlini.ca</span>. As it turns out, when your computer sends messages 
	over the internet, they <i>do not use domain names</i>; in fact, they 
	use <i>IP addresses</i>. Domain names are for the benefit of human 
	beings who can't easily remember long strings of numbers.</p>
	
	<p>To draw an analogy, a computer's IP address is like a person's phone 
	number. You need to know the person's phone number to actually call 
	them, but usually you only remember their name. If you don't know a 
	person's number, you can look it up in the phonebook or browse a list 
	of contacts on your phone.</p>
	
	<p>In the context of the internet, the phone book is called the Domain 
	Name System (DNS). When you want to make your own website, you 
	essentially want to add a new DNS entry that maps your desired domain 
	name to the IP address of your server.</p>
	
	<h3>Buying a Domain Name</h3>
	
	<p>This is where things get complicated. Basically, there is an 
	organization out there called the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers 
	Authority) who manage a number of so-called <i>DNS root servers</i>. 
	You can see the list <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers">
		
	here</a>. When you go to a website, your web browser will first look up 
	the domain name by sending a query to one of these machines; </p>
	
	<div class="inset">
	<div class="inset_title">But How Do I Look Up a Root Server?</div>
	
	<p>You may think this is a chicken-and-egg situation. To convert a 
	domain to an IP address, I have to get the IP address for a root 
	server. And how do I do that? I have to look up its domain name.</p>
	
	<p>This is why the root servers must have "well-known" IP addresses. If 
	you didn't already know the IP address, there would be no way you could 
	get it.</p>
	
	<p>Just to let you know: Google manages its own DNS name resolver at IP 
	address <span class="code">8.8.8.8</span>. Although Google probably 
	uses this DNS server to track what websites people go to, it's a lot 
	easier to remember this IP address than the official ones. </p>
	
	<p>Another pro tip: you can often use your internet router as a DNS 
	resolver. This is usually the better way to go because the router will 
	in turn ask your ISP, who caches most common domain names.</p>
