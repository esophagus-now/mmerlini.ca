	<h1>Linux Driver Series</h1>

    <p>I had wanted to understand how device drivers worked ever since I was in 
    high school. As it turns out, device drivers are relatively easy to 
    understand; it's just hard to find clear and precise explanations. </p>
    
    <p>The goal of this article series is to assemble information from a lot of 
    different places into one cohesive (and self-contained) tutorial. My target 
    audience is at the high school level, but I do assume you understand C code 
    and pointers.</p>
    
    <p>Below you will find a list of my primary resources, and my plan for the 
    different articles in this series.</p>

        <p>I am not an authority on Linux. Although I make every attempt to 
        ensure correct information, there can be errors. If you spot any 
        mistakes, I really want to know about it!</p>

    <p>Although I said it was hard to find clear and precise explanations, 
    don't get the wrong idea: there is a lot of documentation out there. The 
    information in this series is 90% from the following books/websites, and 
    about 10% is from my own experience.</p>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li><a href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/">Linux Device Drivers, 
        3<sup>rd</sup> edition.</a> Don't be fooled by its old age; almost all 
        of the information is still correct. Best of all, the book is free.
        
        <li><a 
        href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-the-linux/0596005652/">Understanding 
        the Linux Kernel.</a> This book demystifies a lot of Linux kernel 
        internals. I find it's a good starting point when you want to get an 
        idea of what's going on behind the scenes.</li>
        
        <li> <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source">The Linux 
        kernel source code itself</a>. Part of this article series will explain 
        some common techniques used in Linux kernel code; soon you will find 
        that the code is extremely well-written and is much easier to read than 
        you would expect. </li>
        
        <li>A whole host of one-off posts scattered around the internet. I'll 
        do my best to link them in.</li>
        
    </ul>
